# TDD practice
Solve the problem using:
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Design patterns
* Refactoring technics

Your solution should be:
* Well-designed
* easy and safe to change
* clean code without code smells nor anti-patterns
* it is fine to over-engineering a little bit for practice propose.

# The Problem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz

**IMPORTANT!!!** use the refactor phase to improve your application design.

[find suggested steps on TDD_ROUND_STEPS.MD file](/TDD_STEPS.md)

## Requirements
Create an application which allows the user to:
1. Request FizzBuzz value for a given position.
2. Request FizzBuzz values between 2 positions.
3. Request FizzBuzz values up to one position.

## Bonus
Is your application well-designed and easy to change?
If so, can you make the program flexible?

Allow the user to provide numbers and strings which replace default values and numbers.
* numbers should be primitives greater than 2, should not allow duplicated numbers.
* strings cannot be "fizz" "buzz", nor be duplicated strings.
* default behavior should remain available.
